Retail Sales Forecasting

This repository contains my work for the "Future Interns" Machine Learning Task – Sales Forecasting.

The aim of this project was to use historical retail sales data to create a basic time-series forecasting model and visualize the results. The focus was mainly on understanding the data, building a simple forecasting approach, and presenting the output clearly.

Files included:
- sales_forecasting_notebook.ipynb – Google Colab notebook with all steps (data loading, processing, model, forecast export).
- historical_sales.csv – cleaned daily sales data.
- sales_forecast.csv – forecast output.
- dashboard.png – screenshot of the visual dashboard created for analysis.

Tools used:
- Python (Colab)
- Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- Google Looker Studio for the dashboard
- GitHub for project storage

Work summary:
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
- Converted and aggregated sales by date.
- Built a simple regression-based time series forecast.
- Generated future predictions.
- Created a dashboard to compare actual vs predicted sales.

This project helped me understand time-series basics, working with forecasting in Python, and creating a clear report/dashboard for results.

Task Status: Completed
