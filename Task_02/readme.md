Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains my work for the "Future Interns" Machine Learning Task – Customer Churn Prediction.
The aim of this project was to analyze telecom customer data and build a machine-learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn. The focus was on data preprocessing, classification model training, and visualizing customer churn insights.
Tools used

-Python (Colab)
-Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn
-Google Looker Studio for dashboard visualization
-GitHub for version control

Work summary

-Loaded and explored the dataset
-Cleaned and preprocessed data
-Encoded categorical variables
-Trained a Logistic Regression model
-Generated churn predictions
-Created a dashboard to visualize churn patterns

This project helped me understand classification modeling, data preprocessing, and presenting business insights using ML and dashboards.

Task Status: Completed ✅
